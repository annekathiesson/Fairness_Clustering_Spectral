# Fairness_Clustering_Spectral
This repository contains the implementation of FairDen, a fairness-aware density-based clustering algorithm developed as part of a bachelor project and later published at ICLR 2025 ([link to paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=aPHHhnZktB)). The project addresses the underexplored problem of fairness in density-based clustering by integrating a novel density-connectivity metric with fair spectral clustering methods, enabling fair, density-aware clustering without losing the ability to detect non-convex shapes or handle noise. FairDen is evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets (Adult Census and Bank Marketing) using fairness and clustering   quality metrics, demonstrating improved fairness over vanilla DBSCAN with minimal trade-offs in cluster quality. The repository includes the MATLAB-to-Python translation for fair spectral clustering, experiment scripts, and results, allowing for the full reproduction of the paperâ€™s findings. This work highlights the importance of fairness in unsupervised learning and offers a practical approach for mitigating bias in applications such as social network analysis and image segmentation.
